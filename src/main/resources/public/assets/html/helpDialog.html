    	<h2>Welcome to ScheduSmart!</h2>
	    <p>This application allows you to find the best class schedule based on your preferences. Here are some tips for getting started:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Begin by opening the left search menu, and selecting your term and courses.</li>
			<li>Section types selected under 'hide sections' will be hidden and disregarded.</li>
			<li>Under 'prefered class time', selecting 'morning' will prioritize classes before noon, and 'afternoon' will prioritize classes after noon.</li>
			<li>Under 'day length preference', selecting 'less class per day' will balance class time evenly across the week, and 'less school days' will move all class time to the same days, minimizing the amount of school days.</li>
			<li>Selecting 'hide closed sections' will ignore sections that are full or otherwise closed.</li>
			<li>Once ready to generate schedules, press 'Search'.</li>
			<li>The schedules will be ordered from best to worst. Use the 'Prev' and 'Next' buttons to navigate them.</li>
			<li>Use the button at the top-right of the page to switch between week view and list view for each schedule.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> Tip: Too many schedules returned? Try ignoring section types (under 'ignore sections') that have a lot possibilities, like TUTs.</p>
  		<p> Note: Online courses are always ignored. </p>
